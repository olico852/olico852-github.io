## GA SG WDI 7 Project 1 - Pong

This is my project 1 submission for General Assembly's 12 week Web Development Immersive course. I created a two player game of the arcade classic Pong using HTML, CSS, Javascript DOM Manipulation to build my project. Animations were done through a combination of sprite sheet and .requestAnimationFrame to animate my elements. HTML5 Canvas was not used.

## Getting Started

Please clone and fork the following files and you're ready to load 'index.html' file to play :
index.html
main-MVP5JanEve.js
raf-polyfill.js
style.css

### Project Prerequisites

Display a game in the browser
Switch turns between two players, or switch turns between a player and the computer (AI)*
Design logic for winning & visually display which player won
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation
Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it**
Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

### How to Use

Player 1 controls the left paddle using 'W' and 'S' keys.
Player 2 controls the right paddle using up and down arrow keys.
Press the space bar to start the game and launch the ball for each round.
Each player scores a point when its opponent is unable to return the ball.
Whoever secures 5 points first is the winner for that level.

## Workflow

Upon deciding on the game and the game logic, I drew wire frames to help get my project off the ground. I do enjoy keeping a physical list of tasks at hand and that kept me on track. Source control was mostly done on my local drive with the occasional Github update.

I wanted to make an animated game not utilising HTML5 Canvas. This article inspired me to try out sprite sheets and was a very useful starting point http://buildnewgames.com/dom-sprites/
